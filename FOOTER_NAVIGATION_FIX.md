# Footer Navigation Fix

## Issue
Footer Quick Links were using regular `<a>` tags causing full page reloads and incorrect category filtering.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Footer Component
- Replaced all `<a>` tags with React Router `<Link>` components
- Fixed category slugs to match database values
- Added proper navigation for wholesale filtering

### 2. Category Slug Mapping

**Footer Links → Database Category Slugs:**
- Medicines → `prescription-medicines`
- Cosmetics → `cosmetics-personal-care`
- Medical Equipment → `medical-equipment`
- Wholesale Portal → Uses `?wholesale=true` query parameter
- About Us → `/about`

### 3. How It Works

**Category Filtering Flow:**
1. User clicks "Cosmetics" in footer
2. Navigates to `/products?category=cosmetics-personal-care`
3. Products page reads `category` query parameter
4. `useProducts` hook looks up category by slug
5. Filters products by matching category_id
6. Only cosmetics products are displayed

**Wholesale Filtering Flow:**
1. User clicks "Wholesale Portal" in footer
2. Navigates to `/products?wholesale=true`
3. Products page reads `wholesale` query parameter
4. Filters products where `wholesale_available = true`

### 4. Benefits
✅ No page reloads - smooth SPA navigation
✅ Correct category filtering by slug
✅ Maintains app state during navigation
✅ Better user experience
✅ Faster navigation

### 5. Database Categories
Available categories in the system:
- `biomedical-equipments` - Biomedical Equipments
- `cosmetics-personal-care` - Cosmetics & Personal Care
- `first-aid-wellness` - First Aid & Wellness
- `medical-equipment` - Medical Equipment
- `over-the-counter` - Over-the-Counter
- `prescription-medicines` - Prescription Medicines

## Files Modified
- `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - Updated Quick Links navigation
- No changes needed to Products page (already handles category filtering correctly)

## Testing
Test each Quick Link to verify:
1. Click "Medicines" → Shows only prescription medicines
2. Click "Cosmetics" → Shows only cosmetics & personal care products
3. Click "Medical Equipment" → Shows only medical equipment
4. Click "Wholesale Portal" → Shows only wholesale-available products
5. Click "About Us" → Navigates to about page
